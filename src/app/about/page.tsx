        <p>
          I was born in Contagem and moved to{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte">
            Belo Horizonte
          </a>{" "}
          where I currently live. I fell in love with technology, games and the
          culture of building things that can impact people&apos;s lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next decade, I{" "}

            explored music
          </a>
          , played a lot of video games and started to get curious about how
          software and systems really work behind the scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I studied Information Systems at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.pucminas.br">
            Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais (PUC Minas)
          </a>
          , where I focused on backend development and expanded my knowledge in
          databases, APIs and programming languages like TypeScript, JavaScript,
          Node.js and C#.
        </p>
        <p>
          My curiosity led me to dive deeper into web technologies. I learned{" "}
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>,{" "}
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">
            JavaScript
          </a>{" "}
          before progressing to frameworks like Vue.js, React and Angular,
          always aiming to connect frontend and backend in meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve been building projects that integrate APIs, databases like{" "}
          <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server">SQL Server</a>,
          and experimenting with{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">
            Machine Learning
          </a>{" "}
          applied to games â€” which also became the theme of my thesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I work as a Junior Developer, where I keep improving my skills,
          collaborating with teams, and contributing to building efficient
          server-side solutions.
